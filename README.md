Week 1
------

Each worksheet will occupy a whole seance. You first need to download the worksheet on your computer and then access it through the jupyter notebook.

- [Jupyter worksheet 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/videlec/aims-python-rwanda-2016/master/worksheets/worksheet1.ipynb) basic Python and plotting ([view it online (read-only version)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/videlec/aims-python-rwanda-2016/blob/master/worksheets/worksheet1.ipynb))
- [Jupyter worksheet 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/videlec/aims-python-rwanda-2016/master/worksheets/worksheet2.ipynb) conditional, loops, iterators ([view it online](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/videlec/aims-python-rwanda-2016/blob/master/worksheets/worksheet2.ipynb))
- [Jupyter worksheet 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/videlec/aims-python-rwanda-2016/master/worksheets/worksheet3.ipynb) functions ([view it online](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/videlec/aims-python-rwanda-2016/blob/master/worksheets/worksheet3.ipynb))

The subject of the assignment is [arith.pdf](https://github.com/videlec/aims-python-rwanda-2016/raw/master/assignment/arith.pdf). You
should program all functions inside a single worksheet. To submit your assignment,
go to the Jupyter menu and download the worksheet in ipynb format ("File ->
Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb)"). Then send this file by mail at
vincent.delecroix@labri.fr
